To deny the importance of the cash price of an item is an unrealistic ___ of trying to live more sustainably. Cash is representative of our personal time and energy which is perhaps the most limited resource of all of them. To disregard the cash value price associated with an item in favor of the other resources perhaps would be charitable of the super rich but would create imbalance for most of us.
