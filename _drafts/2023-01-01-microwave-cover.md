One thing we love is leftovers, and more often than not those leftovers find themselves spinning around in the microwave before becoming out next meal. To help save ourselves the trouble of cleaning the entire microwave it is pretty common for us to throw a paper towel over our food so we don't end up with a volcanic eruption of tomato sauce glued to all of the walls and ceiling of our microwave. 

And then that paper towel damp and soggy from doing it's job gets tossed in teh trash usually before we even sit down for our meal.

Often this paper towel plays a preventative role and isn't even that dirty. So in an effort to create less waste we wanted to know .... is getting a microwave cover better? even if it's plastic?
