For many, one of both the fist and the last things we do every single day is brush our teeth. 

This is somewhat tricky to compare because people have pretty different habits when it comes to brushing their teeth. In particular how much toothpaste people apply to their tootbrush when brushing.

The point of toothpaste is to help remove food debris and plaque from your teeth and gums, and it is recommended by the American Dental Association to apply approximately the size of a pea on your toothbrush each time you brush your teeth.

You'll notice many toothpaste advertisements show a much larger "swoosh" of toothpaste on the brush than necessary, as their goal is to get customers to purchase more toothpaste.
