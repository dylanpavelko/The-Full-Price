As tempting as it may be to go out and buy a bunch of new products that are better for your wallet and earth than whatever you currently have lying around at home alreadyâ€“ do not do it!

The goal of this site is not increased consumerism, and if you already have purchased items in your home that are still functional the best thing you can do is to continue using them. So don't go throwing out your plastic dish scrummber in favor of natural fiber product in an effort to be more green. The products you have in your house have already been made and the impact to the environment has already happened. By throwing it out and buying new items even if they are 'better' it is still a net-increase in waste of our resources. Resist the urge to shop until you have a need.
